## Installation

Simply place btcbar.app in your `/Applications` folder, and optionally add it to `Login Items` in `System Preferences > Users & Groups` to display it automatically on startup.

## Download

The current version of btcbar (2.0.0) can be downloaded here:

https://github.com/nearengine/btcbar/blob/master/Release/btcbar_2_0_0.zip?raw=true

It requires OS X 10.7+ and a 64-bit processor.

## Changelog

### 2.0.0

Version 2 adds Bitstamp and Coinbase, and a little more backend abstraction so it will be easier to add additional tickers in the future.

TODO:

* Live updating prices for each menu item in the dropdown
* More abstraction of tickers

### 1.0.0

Version 1.0 is the first release, which updates from MtGox's ticker API.
